   <!-- -180.4336 = static margin of -4%mac
        
        2020 Sept:
        
        CoG is 3.5in, AeroRP is -1.9336in
        4%mac = 0.4528ft = 5.4336in
        
        -1.9336in - 3.5in = 5.4336in
        
        Main-wheels is 0.56097m on X, which is 22.08543in
          18.58543in from CoG
        
        
          
        2020 Oct:
                
        Pseudo fuel system and stores adjusted to not mess too much with static margin.
        
        Static margin translated aft 5in to about 14in from MLG, which is about 10% of distance from MLG to NLG.
        The real (Block 10/15) CoG is 13in from MLG on X, and about 8.5-9in below engine Z. [Source: TO 1F-16A-1 change 14 2003]
